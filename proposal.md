# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Fiend Realm 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This is a game that will progress harder and harder as you move up through realm of Fiends and fight evil beings to be rewarded with equipment that will help you progress, the  game also consist of minions of these feinds being, where you will gain experience every kill, and have a chance to get a drop reward from it.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

the code will use python to program, and with the help of pygame to make the game, pygame will help me create the game to run and there will be feature such as choosing character, weapons from drops, interaction with monster, and an upgrade feature for reaching a certain lvl with the class.
With the help of pygame i would laso be able to make level/stages for every realm, and control the character as to move around, attack monster or opening inventory and storing equipments. The game will be executed in mostly a loop sequence that updates the users progress and save it, and when moving into a new realm the loop is repeated to summon monter randomly and make it more difficult.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

ui for the game works
charcter control (moving, attacking, dash, etc)
fighting monster (ability to kill the monster and to lose damage when you get hit by monster)
choose classes to play with

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

getting drops from monster and being able to equip it
level progression works well
the class you chose are able to be upgrade into a stronger version when reaching a certain lvl
go through level of realms (atleast 1)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

being able to make 10 realm/stages that consist of different bosses to fight and different reward as prices
achievements that reward you with coins to purchase new character or costume for the character
being able to save the progression of the character in game
hopefully once progression system work try to make it into an online feature

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

after being able to make the game, I would be able to get closer to understanding more on how game development works and the skills that will be acquired will be the understanding of how pygame works how to code in pygame, and a more advance understanding in python through this project. The topic that I will need to research in how to code in pygame, if it works like python, and if I would need to learn the pyshics of the game and testing the game for bugs, the character design, the realm design, and possibly music for the game. I will be doing it all myself.
