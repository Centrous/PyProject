# PyProject
Python Project for CIS Course, Plan is to make a game

## Options:
Top down RPG game(highly motivated for this)
An old RPG game with the help of ASCII and alot of Random odds and chances, so will be using alot of random.___ and dictionary
A game similar to galaxy invaders space shooter  
(not a game) a notepade/document app, where u can save ur list of things to do daily, and u set it to remind u on the day/time with alarm feature on it (going to have to learn how to do the time alarm)- but this seems to be the least likely

# Difficulties faced and had to overcome:
Time management and art was one of the biggest difficulties, I underestimated the time I had, and should've listened when it was mentioned that "if you expect the game to be done is a certain period of time, double that time" eventually got the work done but was missing some parts that I wished I could've shared, next problem was ui, some didn't look as good as I imagined and writing the code itself had a lot of issue as a huge code would take a long time to figure a small error, 1 small error took me about 3 hours to find at one point.
Camera was also an issue with my game, I had to spend about 8 hours in youtube to learn about camera and which works best fit for my game, and it ended up being a follow camera
another difficultied I faced was attacking enemies, not so much of a problem just confused on how to make leftclicking attack works, but ended up giving up on that idea and sticking with spacebar to attack.

# Things learned:
Code with pygames, pixel art, understand game development and some animation (didn't add any animation to the game, cuz it took a longer time than given)

# Goal was it reached?
No, the Goal i had planned in mind was to make different class to be played, unfortunately i could only make 1 class at the point, weapons were able to be made, and score were able to be added to stats, however no weapon drop & pickup was able to be added due to lack of time. overall game was functional however lack couple of important aspect that I was hoping to be included to the final work. Would say i made a good Progess, only thing i have to complain is the pixel art, creating a pixel art took way longer than expected which cause to mess up the goal i made.

# what you enjoyed?
Honestly enjoyed the whole process of learning to code the game, and developing it, planning to continue the game and hopefully one day, it will look better than the current state of the game.
