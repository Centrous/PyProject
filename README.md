# PyProject
Python Project for CIS Course, Plan is to make a game

## Options:
Top down RPG game(highly motivated for this)
An old RPG game with the help of ASCII and alot of Random odds and chances, so will be using alot of random.___ and dictionary
A game similar to galaxy invaders space shooter  
(not a game) a notepade/document app, where u can save ur list of things to do daily, and u set it to remind u on the day/time with alarm feature on it (going to have to learn how to do the time alarm)- but this seems to be the least likely
